# Goals

Silicon, relative to most major general purpose programming languages _is_ **simple**. Being **simple** is not

## List

- WASM compilation target
- Full-Stack web dev
- blazingly fast compilation
- interpreted for fast dev cycles
- Algebraic Data Types
- Pattern Matching
- 100% Type Inference (safety without type gymnastics)
- Co-routines (no colored functions)
- ARC (no GC)
- 100% Web API compatability
- 100% Node API compatability

## Non-Goals

In my opinion, non-goals are just as important as goals. They prevent scope-screep and keep the language and toolchain _great_ at specific use-case instead of
mediocre at everything.

\*Not a direct goal but other tools will be used
\*\*A future, much less important goal to think about

- Native Compilation\*
- LLVM / other native backends\*
- ~~Variadic functions~~
- ~~Function over-loading~~
- Game dev
- Systems dev (Yes, even though Silicon has no GC and is fairly "low-level")
- Operator overloading
- Functionally Pure
- Borrower Checker / compile-type memory safety\*\*
