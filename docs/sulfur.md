# Sulfur

Sulfur is a dynamic super-set of Silicon. Much like how Typescript is a superset of JavaScript. This means **ALL** Silicon is valid Sulfur but not the other way around. 

## Benefits

There are MANY benefits to this. 

1. Silicon stays focused. No ONE language can do it all well.
1. Silicon can be self-embeddable! Much like Lua. But no overhead since it has the same data-model!
1. Easily incrementally upgrade a dynmaic project to a statically typed compiled and safe project! 
1. Silicon is it's own scripting language
1. The language can modify itself at runtime! Easy live updates without recompilation.

All of these are bilingual tech stacks

 ### Stacks
- Lua + C++
- JavaScript then rewrite in Go, Rust etc
- CGo: Go + C
- C++ but then bash for cmake.
- JavaScript on front-end, Java on backend
