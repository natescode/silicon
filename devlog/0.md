# Silicon - Devlog 0

Designing a programming language.

Before I get into parsing, ASTs etc which numerous blog posts and books cover, I want to go over something less discussed, programming language design.

Most blogs series and books will cover a "toy" compiler or interpreter. Which is totally fine. I think this makes learning intermediate concepts difficult. Advanced concepts aren't difficult with enough experience and expertise.


## Define the Problem

In order for Silicon to be useful, it needs to solve a real problem in a way that no other language is solving or solving as well currently. Syntax doesn't matter that much. Anyone that complains about syntax is missing the point.

Silicon is trying to be a full-stack web language that is gradually typed and optionally dynamic. It is very simple and basically two complimentary languages in one!

## Complexity Breeds Complexity

Complexity increases exponentially. Simple language features like implict returns can have major future effects on the language. I want Silicon to be future-proof but still flexible; think Lisp.


## Use Case for Silicon

I've read many blog posts about teams switching from highly productive dynamic languages like Python, Ruby and JavaScript to more performant and static languages like Go, and Crablang. 

At first, a reader may think they initially chose the *wrong* language but that isn't the case at all. Especially for startups, time-to-market is critical. Having a productive, flexible toolchain is a must. *Later*, when the users and money arrive *then* safety, and performance become more important. Unfortunately, that often means a complete rewrite. Facebook made PHP into a compiled language for this reason. What if there was **ONE** language with **TWO** modes that allowed almost seemless incremental migration from a productive, flexible language to a safe and performant one.


## Two languages to rule them all

Much like how Typescript is a superset of JavaScript, Sulfur is a dynamic superset of Silicon. This works really well. Furthermore, Sulfur is still very lightweight and embeddable, like Lua, inside Silicon binaries!
